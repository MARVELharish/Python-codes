Python Coding Challenge: 10 Programs a Day

Overview

As part of my ongoing learning journey in Python, I've committed to writing 10 Python programs each day for the next 10 days and sharing them here on GitHub.
This challenge is designed to help me improve my coding skills, get better at problem-solving, and become more familiar with a variety of Python concepts and libraries.
